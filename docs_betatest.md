# Beta Test Programme
Welcome to the Marxan Web Beta Test Programme. This page gives instructions for the Beta testers on where to go and what to do for the testing programme. Thanks for taking part.

## What to test
Marxan Web is available as a hosted service (i.e. where no software installation is required - only a browser is needed) and as a downloadable installation for a local computer. Both of these have exactly the same set of features. We would like to test both of these. Please follow the instructions below for either system. Full documentation is given [here](/index.html.md).  

### Marxan Web Hosted Service
1. Goto: [https://beta.biopama.org/marxan-client/build/](https://beta.biopama.org/marxan-client/build/)
1. Select the 'Beta Test' server
1. Click Register, enter you details and login  

### Marxan Web install version
1. Goto: [https://github.com/marxanweb/marxan-web/releases/tag/v0.9.0_beta](https://github.com/marxanweb/marxan-web/releases/tag/v0.9.0_beta)
1. Follow the instructions  

## Bugs and feature requests
There will be bugs! Please report any bugs to the Marxan Web repository on GitHub by following the instructions in the [User Guide](docs_user.html#providing-feedback). In order to help fix bugs the following information would be really helpful:

- The software that you are testing and on what browser.  
- A detailed step-by-step set of instructions to reproduce the bug.  
- Ideally, any errors that are reported in the browsers Console - this is a Developer tool that can be opened in the browser to help understand any errors when they occur. To open the console follow these links: for [Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/open#chrome), [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console/Opening_the_Web_Console), [Safari](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri20948/mac), [Internet Explorer](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/gg589530(v=vs.71)). Errors will be shown in red - please copy and paste these into the GitHub issue.  

There are some known bugs in the underlying DOS-based Marxan software which will be addressed before the full release of Marxan Web.  

For feature requests, please also add them as issues in the Marxan Web repository on GitHub by following the instructions in the [User Guide](docs_user.html#providing-feedback).

## Notes 
- All data that is uploaded in the Beta testing programme will be in the public domain and will be deleted at the end of the programme. Please don't upload any sensitive or unlicensed data.  

- The Marxan Web hosted service is running on a machine with a single processor and this will be shared by all users. Therefore in some cases the performance may be very slow when multiple users are using the tool. Please try to keep the number of iterations for a project as low as possible and also please don't share the link to the Beta Test website just yet. This should not be an issue for the release version of Marxan Web as it will be hosted on a production-ready machine with multiple processors and there may also be additional instances hosted in other organisations.  

- To view all of the projects on the hosted service (as a read-only user) you can log in as a Guest user (guest/password). These include case studies in the Coral Triangle and Papua New Guinea.  

- In the Windows version, not all the World Database of Protected Areas is included by default - it is only available for countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. If you are logged in as admin you can update to the full most-recent version by following the instructions on screen (use the credentials admin/password).    

## Timeline
The Beta Test programme will end on 31/10/2019. Please try and submit all bugs and feature requests by this date.
